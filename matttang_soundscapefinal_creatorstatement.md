### Introduction/Creator's Statement & Project Reflection
Most if not all of us can relate to the feeling of falling out of love with a hobby or skill due to a repetitive and routine nature. You pick it up originally out of interest and curiosity, but you eventually lose sight of why you're doing something. For me, I experienced this with the violin. I wanted to use my Soundscape not only to share my personal experiences but also to tell a story that hopefully resonates with others no matter what their hobby or skill may be. I initially picked up the violin due to pure curiosity and interest, but the more structured the hobby became with practice and lessons, the less motivated I was to continue. This feeling of tunnel vision can apply to anything, and I wanted to share this message with my audience to act as a reminder to take a step back and remember why you're doing something in the first place.

I tried to tell this story through multiple techniques and effects. When I first picked up the violin as a child, the only thing I could do was pluck the strings of the instrument. I had no idea what I was doing, and simply plucking the strings as a child represented my initial curiosity and joy when interacting with the instrument. This is important to note, as it plays a significant role in the overall story.

The next part showcases something starting as a hobby, then turning into a chore, and then eventually a burden. This is done through a back-and-forth with violin audio following short bits of narration audio. I intentionally used scales and arpeggios in this scene because even though the same notes are played, the speed and difficulty gradually increases. When we learn something new, we often take slow, simple steps. As we become more adept at the skill, the difficulty advances, and the expectations put on us significantly grow. 

To represent pressure growing, there are two tracks of tuning that are overlaid. I used the fade-in tool and tremolo effect to drive in this emotion. My goal was for the listener to feel anxious and nervous from the increasing volume and tremble. I also used the amplify tool to make this as loud as possible without being overbearing. This is supposed to lead up to the climax.

A loud pluck shortly follows this build-up, which represents a breaking point. I originally wanted to include an imported audio of a string snapping, but I chose to record this instead because I wanted to tell a cohesive story throughout using mainly the notes used in tuning the violin (G, D, A, and E). I used the fade-out effect here to transition into silence, as this represents a period in my life where I stopped playing the violin because the stress and pressure became too much to bear. 

The narration that follows reiterates this breaking point, and the silence that follows is intentional. This is meant to represent silence without any violin audio, as it was a period when I didn't play the violin. However, the silence is also meant to add to the emotional effect experienced by the listener so that they can think about their own lived experiences and hopefully relate to this temporary pause. 

Finally, the last scene incorporates a lot of repetition to finish the story. The zipping violin case audio was repeated to represent opening the case instead of the initial closing of it, and the page-turn audio was also copied to represent falling back into love with the instrument. The plucking sound used in the very beginning was repeated at the end to show how the initial joy and curiosity returned after taking a step back and remembering why I picked up the violin in the first place.

One challenge that I faced during this process was how to balance the narration and incorporate sounds. For my preview, most of the Soundscape was narration, and I didn't know how to capture specific emotions through songs. After playing around, I found a balance between having scenes where the narration and violin go back and forth. I thought that this was the best way to convey emotions without explicitly stating my experiences. By having less narration and more audios and effects embedded throughout the Soundscape, my aim was to "show more than tell" and allow the listener to refect about how they may relate to this feeling of falling out and back in love with a hobby, skill, or interest.
