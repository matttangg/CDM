### Introduction/Creator's Statement & Project Reflection
Most if not all of us can relate to the feeling of falling out of love with a hobby or skill due to a repetitive and routine nature. You pick it up originally out of interest and curiosity, but you eventually lose sight of why you're doing something. For me, I experienced this with the violin. I wanted to use my Soundscape not only to share my personal experiences but also to tell a story that hopefully resonates with others no matter what their hobby or skill may be. I initially picked up the violin due to pure curiosity and interest, but the more structured the hobby became with practice and lessons, the less motivated I was to continue. This feeling of tunnel vision can apply to anything, and I wanted to share this message with my audience to act as a reminder to take a step back and remember why you're doing something in the first place.

I tried to tell this story through multiple techniques and effects. When I first picked up the violin as a child, the only thing I could do was pluck the strings of the instrument. I had no idea what I was doing, and simply plucking the strings as a child represented my initial curiosity and joy when interacting with the instrument. This is important to note, as it plays a significant role in the overall story.

words introducing/explaining the piece and reflecting on the process of creating your soundscape narrative. You can borrow some of the language that you used in your introduction, but you will want to expand on that introduction to reflect on your design choices came out of your initial vision for the project and how they evolved as you encountered logistical challenges, technical challenges, feedback from others, or your own evolving conception of the project.
